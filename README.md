## Code Standards

 We avoid [bike shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) by enforcing coding standards through tooling.

 - Ruby - [standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard)
 - JavaScript - [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

 Ensure the code is standardized by running the following before you commit.

 ```sh
 ./bin/standardize
 ```

## Candidates for GEM extraction

- Searchable ActiveStorage metadata
