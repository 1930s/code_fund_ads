## Code Standards

 We avoid [bike shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) by enforcing coding standards through tooling.

 - Ruby - [standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard)

   Run the following before committing.

   ```sh
   bundle exec standard
   ```

 - JavaScript - [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

   Run the following before committing.

   ```sh
   prettier --write app/**/*.js
   ```

## Candidates for GEM extraction

- Searchable ActiveStorage metadata
